# Library App

## Summary

So here I did a project based on the game "Where's Waldo". This is my take on it and I decided to do it based on a Kirby! I think the genre goes along the lines of "Search and Find...".

## Things learned

Honestly with the practice that I got from re-doing my project (Library App) it helped push my skills with Firebase much further. I still wouldn't consider myself a pro, but I definitely understand more!

I struggled with using the image map and area tags at first. It took a little to get that I needed to hide the kirbys coordinates on the backend (Firebase), so that the user couldn't cheat. If I ended up using the area and image mapping, users could cheat by just inspecting the page.

With this project, I also had a hard time understanding how to plot the coordinates dynamically. Depending on the user's screen, the coordinates would change, so I ended up researching information about getting the relative X/Y from offSet method and doing some math relative to the user's screen size. Then I was getting an absolute coordinates regardless of which kirby I was clicking on. At that point, it was pretty easy to figure out.
